                <div class="scientific-facts">
                    <ol>
                        <li>I told my mom I wanted to be a pilot; she said, 'Just make sure you fly above the traffic.'
                        </li>
                        <li>If my bank account had feelings, it would be depressed.</li>
                        <li>You know you're in Africa when you can hear 'Please hold' and you hold the phone, not your
                            breath!</li>
                        <li>I told my friend I was going to eat a healthy salad; he said, 'Just add chicken and call it
                            a feast!'</li>
                        <li>The only time I run is when I see a snake... or my mom with a belt.</li>
                        <li>I don’t need an alarm clock; my neighbor’s rooster is the loudest snooze button.</li>
                        <li>In my family, we don’t have a pet; we have a livestock farm, and yes, they’re all named
                            after my aunts!</li>
                        <li>My phone battery lasts longer than my motivation to go to the gym.</li>
                        <li>When you ask for Wi-Fi and they say, 'It’s in the fridge, just look for the router!'</li>
                        <li>My uncle says he’s on a seafood diet; I see food, and I eat it!</li>
                        <li>I went to a party where the food was so good, even the plates were smiling!</li>
                        <li>The only reason I exercise is to stay fit enough to run away from my responsibilities.</li>
                        <li>They say money can't buy happiness, but I’d rather cry in a Ferrari than on a bicycle!</li>
                        <li>When my mom asks, 'Are you hungry?' I say no; it's safer than saying yes!</li>
                        <li>My plans for the weekend? Well, let's just say my couch is expecting me.</li>
                        <li>You know you’re late when the only person at the party is the person who made it.</li>
                        <li>My diet plan is simple: if I see food, I eat it, and if I don’t see food, I go looking!</li>
                        <li>In Africa, we don’t have a summer body; we just have a body that knows how to survive
                            winter!</li>
                        <li>I’m on a seafood diet; I see food, and I eat it. Especially if it’s Jollof!</li>
                        <li>Why do we call it 'rush hour' when nothing moves?</li>
                        <li>My mom says I should find a rich husband; I told her I’m still trying to find my socks!</li>
                        <li>They say love is blind; I say it’s just wearing really dark glasses.</li>
                        <li>In our family, we don’t have secrets; we have rumors!</li>
                        <li>I have a fear of elevators; I’m going to start taking steps to avoid them!</li>
                        <li>You know you’re African when your parents’ friends become your friends, and you have to call
                            them ‘Auntie’ and ‘Uncle’!</li>
                        <li>When I hear 'free food,' my feet move faster than my brain!</li>
                        <li>My bank account and I have a love-hate relationship; I love to spend, and it hates me for
                            it!</li>
                        <li>When I see food, I get a sense of urgency; my mouth starts watering, and my legs start
                            moving!</li>
                        <li>My cousin says he’s on a diet; I told him, 'Eating is not cheating!'</li>
                        <li>I can’t believe it’s already Monday; I feel like I just blinked and it was Friday!</li>
                        <li>My grandma says money talks; I think mine just says, ‘Goodbye!’</li>
                        <li>Why do they call it a ‘building’ when it’s already built?</li>
                        <li>You know you're African when the only time you need a GPS is when you’re trying to avoid
                            your relatives!</li>
                        <li>When I try to eat healthy, along comes a chocolate cake to remind me of my true love!</li>
                        <li>When life gives you lemons, just find someone with tequila and have a party!</li>
                        <li>If laughter is the best medicine, then my family is the pharmacy!</li>
                        <li>I can’t believe I got kicked out of the library for yelling, 'I need to read this!'</li>
                        <li>When you ask for directions, and they send you on a wild goose chase.</li>
                        <li>My new motto is: ‘Eat, sleep, repeat... with snacks in between!’</li>
                        <li>Why do they call it ‘hot chocolate’ when it’s actually warm?</li>
                        <li>When you’re trying to impress someone, but your body betrays you with a loud noise.</li>
                        <li>You know you're in Africa when your Wi-Fi password is longer than your life story.</li>
                        <li>When your mom says, ‘Let’s talk about your future,’ and you start sweating.</li>
                        <li>I’m on a whiskey diet; I’ve lost three days already!</li>
                        <li>My doctor told me to watch my drinking, so now I drink in front of a mirror.</li>
                        <li>When you say 'I’m just looking,' but your heart is screaming, 'Buy it all!'</li>
                        <li>You know you’re in Africa when you can’t tell if it’s a wedding or a funeral based on the
                            music.</li>
                        <li>When you realize your phone’s autocorrect has a better sense of humor than you do.</li>
                        <li>Why do they call it a ‘drive-thru’ when we’re actually just sitting and waiting?</li>
                        <li>My friends say I should stop procrastinating, but I’ll get to that tomorrow.</li>
                        <li>You know you’re an adult when you realize you’re not going to get a nap after school
                            anymore.</li>
                        <li>My phone is my best friend; it’s always there when I need to ignore someone.</li>
                        <li>When you try to cook a fancy dinner but end up ordering takeout.</li>
                        <li>You know you’re in Africa when the only time you hear ‘silence’ is during a power outage!
                        </li>
                        <li>My friend says she’s going to start exercising; I told her to start with a walk to the
                            fridge!</li>
                        <li>When you say you’ll just have one slice of cake but eat the whole thing instead.</li>
                        <li>You know you’re African when your parents think they know everything about your life!</li>
                        <li>When you ask someone for a favor, and they act like it’s a life-or-death situation.</li>
                        <li>I finally learned how to say ‘no’—after I say ‘yes’ first!</li>
                        <li>When your family thinks ‘healthy eating’ means eating only one slice of cake!</li>
                        <li>You know you’re in Africa when the only time you hear ‘quiet’ is during a power outage!</li>
                        <li>I told my mom I’d clean my room; she said, ‘Let’s see how long that lasts!’</li>
                        <li>When your friend says, ‘Let’s just grab a quick snack,’ and you end up at a buffet!</li>
                        <li>You know you’re getting older when your idea of a wild night is staying in!</li>
                        <li>When your friend says they’re going on a diet, and you’re just there for support… with
                            snacks!</li>
                        <li>Why do they call it ‘fast food’ when it takes forever to get it?</li>
                        <li>When you’re feeling great, and then you see your bank account!</li>
                        <li>You know you’re in Africa when every meal is an event, and everyone’s invited!</li>
                        <li>My friend says I should stop eating fast food; I told him I’m just supporting local
                            businesses!</li>
                        <li>When you try to impress someone, but your body has other plans.</li>
